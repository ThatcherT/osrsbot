# Getting Started
You'll probably need to install some Python packages, best of luck.

The main script is bot.py  

If you're not running Linux, you'll need to adapt the `get_and_move_display` function in `utils/gui.py` to your OS.  

First, login to Runelite. The program starts by looking for an open window with the title "Runelite - <rsn>".

You can begin botting on your runescape account by running `python bot.py "<rsn>"`  

Changing the last line of bot.py will determine the activity your account will try to perform.
